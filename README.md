# SpartaHack Volunteer Matchmaker

A full-stack web application built in 24 hours at **SpartaHack XI** that connects volunteers with local community members who need help. Think "Tinder for volunteering" — swipe right to help, get matched, chat, and make a difference.


---

## The Problem

Finding local volunteer opportunities is fragmented and time-consuming. Meanwhile, people who need help (elderly, disabled, busy parents) struggle to find reliable assistance for everyday tasks.

## Our Solution

A smart matching platform that:
- **Matches volunteers** to nearby jobs based on skills, location, and availability
- **Gamifies helping** with a badge achievement system
- **Enables secure communication** through built-in chat
- **Incentivizes organizations** with an Ethereum donation leaderboard

## Features

### Swipe-Based Job Discovery
Browse volunteer opportunities with a Tinder-style swipe interface. Our matching algorithm considers:
- **Distance** — prioritizes jobs close to you
- **Skills** — matches your abilities to job requirements
- **Urgency** — surfaces time-sensitive requests
- **Reliability** — rewards consistent volunteers

### Badge Achievement System
Earn badges across 4 tracks as you volunteer:

| Badge | Track | Levels |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Specialist | Complete skill-tagged jobs | Bronze (1) → Silver (5) → Gold (15) |
| Firefighter | Handle urgent requests (<24h) | Bronze (1) → Silver (5) → Gold (10) |
| Anchor | Months of active participation | Bronze (1mo) → Silver (3mo) → Gold (6mo) |
| Inclusionist | Help with accessibility needs | Bronze (1) → Silver (5) → Gold (5+) |

### Real-Time Chat
Once matched, communicate directly with requesters through our built-in messaging system. No phone numbers or emails exchanged until you're ready.

### AI-Powered Job Posts
- **Smart Description Enhancement** — AI helps requesters write clear, compelling job descriptions
- **Image Generation** — Auto-generate relevant images for job posts

### Ethereum Donation Leaderboard
Organizations can receive ETH donations tracked on-chain. Monthly rounds reward top organizations, creating healthy competition for community impact.
